## L.I. Who Dynamic Schedule

This is intended as an alternative way to view the grid-style schedule for Long Island Who 2017. I found the version on the official website a little difficult to use so I tried to fix some of the issues I was having.

Current features:
* Separated the schedule into tabs by day to make skipping to a specific day easier
* Added striping to the table to make the rows more distinct
* The colors can be inverted, for people who have trouble reading light text on a dark background

Future additions:
* Panel descriptions, either in modal or tooltip form
* TBA
